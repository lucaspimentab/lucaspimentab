Iâ€™m currently a researcher at the **Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)**, working on real-world applications of data science and machine learning, with a special focus on healthcare.

My work includes developing predictive models for intensive care units, supporting clinical decision-making, and analyzing mental health data through natural language processing.

I'm driven by the opportunity to connect technology and healthcare â€” using data to generate meaningful impact in people's lives.
